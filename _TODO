grep -r TODO *

bugs:
	- after creating a cred, page says does not exist. refreshing page shows it does exist

	- deleting a permission should also delete corresponding credentials from that machine

	- sockets should throw exception on errors (instead of writing to log)

current:

	- generate key
		- sudo lshw | grep serial
		- sudo lshw | grep uuid

	- java api
		- retrieve
	- esol
		- db encryption

	- store keys as binary in db? and not use std:string type w/ them?
		- currently they are stored in base64 form

	- change exits to exceptions
		- current: uds connect

	- rewrite base64_decode to use uchar_vec

All:
	- authenticated communication
		- tcp
    - cronjob to keep deamons alive
	- randomize distribution server check in esol

Central Auth:

    - web interface
        - create new set
			- query to see if cred/perm already exists
        - view current set
			- add/edit perm: error handling, string cleaning
	- daemon
		- config file for distro locations
		- propagate all
			- later: propagate changes
		- time of last propagation?
    - database
		- clear query strings
		- logging queries also log the keys -_-
		- handle username/password input
		- seed prng for generating rsa keys
		- encrypt keys before storing to disk
		- remove unneeded functions from impl?
        - backup mechanism for database
		- ensure integrity of database

Distribution:

Host Daemon:
    - save esol pid
    - close all file descriptors? (23)
    - implement protocol
    - key management
    - database / encryption (298)
        - clean strings
        - handles errors
        - triggers
        - hash database entries to ensure integrity?
        - prepared statements
    - authenticate client
    - signal handling (712)
    - secure directory (45, 55)
	- generalize output path
	- integrity checks (encrypt/hash)
    - sanitize env? (6)
    - error 'constant' files

Client API:
    - jni interface
	- easier way to load the shared library

Crypto:
	- aes.h
		- use IV
